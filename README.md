## Project Description:
Solution of travelling salesman using Divide and Conquer algorithm. </br>
The travelling salesman problem (also called the traveling salesperson problem or TSP)
asks the following question: </br>
"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"

## Divide and Conquer algorithm </br>
In divide and conquer approach, the problem in hand, is divided into smaller sub-problems and then each problem is solved independently. When we keep on dividing the subproblems into even smaller sub-problems, we may eventually reach a stage where no more division is possible. Those "atomic" smallest possible sub-problem (fractions) are solved. The solution of all sub-problems is finally merged in order to obtain the solution of an original problem.
</br>
Broadly, we can understand divide-and-conquer approach in a three-step process. </br>
## Divide/Break </br>
This step involves breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems. Sub-problems should represent a part of the original problem. This step generally takes a recursive approach to divide the problem until no sub-problem is further divisible. At this stage, sub-problems become atomic in nature but still represent some part of the actual problem. </br>
## Conquer/Solve </br>
This step receives a lot of smaller sub-problems to be solved. Generally, at this level, the problems are considered 'solved' on their own. </br>
## Merge/Combine </br>
When the smaller sub-problems are solved, this stage recursively combines them until they formulate a solution of the original problem. This algorithmic approach works recursively and conquer & merge steps works so close that they appear as one. </br>
